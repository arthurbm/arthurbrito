- Docker for environment consistency
- Jupyter Notebook for data visualization
- Multiple middleware solutions:
  - Kafka
  - RabbitMQ
  - MQTT
  - gRPC
- Communication protocols:
  - TCP
  - UDP

## üìä Key Features

- Detailed performance metrics
- Comparative analysis of different middlewares
- Protocol behavior evaluation
- Containerized testing environment
- Data visualization and analysis
- Reproducible test scenarios

## üí° Impact

The project provides valuable insights for distributed systems architects and developers, helping them make informed decisions about middleware and protocol selection based on empirical performance data.
